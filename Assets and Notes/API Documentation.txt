How to read this
if there's a / on the end of the line, and the item below it doesn't have a /, this is accesable as JSON
If there IS a / on the sub-item, that is a url, and it should have JSON objects under it.
I'm looking for a better structure for this.

api.clyp.it/
	[id]/
		Status
			String. Appears to be a nice way to check if downloads are enabled or not. Probably only applies to premium users.
		CommentsEnabled
			Boolean. Exactly what it sounds like.
		Category
			String. I don't even know how to set these
		AudioFileId
			String. I don't know why this is even here. It's identical to the Clyp ID. It might matter for premium users with custom urls?
		Title
			String. Title
		Description
			String. Description
		Duration
			Float. File length in s.ms 
		Url
			String. Url for Clyp page (use for sharing externally)
		soundwave
			depricated. Use soundwave.clyp.it/[id]
		Mp3Url
			String. Url pointing to audio.clyp.it/[id].mp3?args
		SecureMp3Url
			String. identical to mp3url. One or the other might be depreicated eventually
		OggUrl
			String. Url pointing to audio.clyp.it/[id].ogg?args
		SecureOggUrl
			String. identical to oggurl. One or the other might be depricated eventually
		DateCreated
			String. Date/Time created. Format: yyyy-mm-ddThh-mm-ss.fffZ
		comments/
	comment/
		[CommentId]
			Comment
				User
				
		
soundwave.clyp.it
	[id]
		returns a JSON array with int values. I don't know the maximum, but I believe it might be either 99/100 or 127/128
		I also don't know if the data is scaled on the site so the max value in the set is scaled to the maximum height, or if it's a static scaled
		This was one of the last things I asked Jordan before I was fired

Notes on Proprietary Information
Nothing in this document is unavailable to the general public.
This can either be sniffed via the website, or in the official API docs.
Yes, the deprication information is private, but it is beneficial to the bandwidth usage for Clyp, Inc.
