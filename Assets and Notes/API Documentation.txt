How to read this
if there's a / on the end of the line, and the item below it doesn't have a /, this is accesable as JSON
If there IS a / on the sub-item, that is a url, and it should have JSON objects under it.
I'm looking for a better structure for this.

Weird little note - It seems the report api is still there, but probably depricated. Report was a POST api that allowed you to report copyright or offensive content, but the site no longer has it, so why bother

api.clyp.it/
	v2/
		IT WOULD SEEM THERE'S A NEW API THAT I NEED TO POKE AND PROD AND FIGURE OUT.
	[id]/

		CommentsEnabled
			Boolean. Exactly what it sounds like.
		Category
			String. I don't even know how to set these
		AudioFileId

soundwave.clyp.it
	[id]
		returns a JSON array with int values. I don't know the maximum, but I believe it might be either 99/100 or 127/128
		I also don't know if the data is scaled on the site so the max value in the set is scaled to the maximum height, or if it's a static scaled
		This was one of the last things I asked Jordan before I was fired
