# Clyp (Clyp-Unofficial) Mobile App Rewrite

This is a reqrite of the Clyp, Inc. mobile application for Android and iOS.

Up until 2017-03-20 I was the Android developer for Clyp. Just before severence, I decided to go against what the CEO had direted and started rewriting the codebase for the mobile app fresh. I also decided that I wanted something that worked on Windows and Windows Phone 10. My choice to use Xamarin was almost set in stone (Plus I wanted to play with Xamarin).

I got as far as implementing a simple API request and doing a bit of UI work before Jordan gave me the bad news that he no longer needed me, and was "pulling the Android app." Status of the iOS app is unknown, other than "it isn't recieving updates" as "99% of our traffic is via the web."

Yes, Jordan, when your mobile apps don't even have deep linking working properly, you aren't going to have traffic when people don't directly access the site's homepage unless they are uploading. Congrats. 

Currently, any use of this API is **unlicenced.** I haven't requested API access. Seeing as I'm no longer affiliated with Clyp, Inc. I can't bypass this. I have a feeling my API request will be rejected anyway. 

Funny how the API request button and Google Form appeared either soon before or soon after my severence.

Another note - I'm going to try my best to keep proprietary information out of this app. Other than the branding colors and API information, the latter of which I have stored mentally and poked around with curl to confirm, this code was written after I left the company
